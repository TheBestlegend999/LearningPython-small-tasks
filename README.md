# Python Learning Journey ♻️

This repository documents my journey of learning Python.  
I started from the very basics and will be adding new tasks, exercises, and projects as I progress.  
The goal is to build strong foundations in Python and eventually move into Machine Learning and AI.

## 📂 Tasks & Exercises

Below is a collection of Python tasks I have completed step by step.  
Each file contains a small program or exercise that demonstrates a specific concept in Python.  

- [01_email_variables.py](tasks/01_email_variables.py) → practice with variables (email properties: title, sender, receiver, etc.)
- [02_average_numbers.py](tasks/02_average_numbers.py) → calculate the average of numbers and check its type
