# Python Learning Journey ♻️

This repository documents my journey of learning Python.  
I started from the very basics and will be adding new tasks, exercises, and projects as I progress.  
The goal is to build strong foundations in Python and eventually move into Machine Learning and AI.

## 📂 Tasks & Exercises

Below is a collection of Python tasks I have completed step by step.  
Each file contains a small program or exercise that demonstrates a specific concept in Python.  

- [01_email_variables.py](tasks/01_email_variables.py) → practice with variables (email properties: title, sender, receiver, etc.)
- [02_average_numbers.py](tasks/02_average_numbers.py) → calculate the average of numbers and check its type
- [03_bmi_calculator.py](tasks/03_bmi_calculator.py) → calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) from weight and height
- [04_user_input_summary.py](tasks/04_user_input_summary.py) → collect user input (name, surname, city) and display a summary sentence
- [05_if_statement_number_check.py](tasks/05_if_statement_number_check.py) → check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if statements
- [06_list_operations.py](tasks/06_list_operations.py) → list creation, deletion, membership check, and iteration with arithmetic operations
- [07_tuple_operations.py](tasks/07_tuple_operations.py) → tuple basics: type, length, slicing, and negative indexing
- [08_dict_config.py](tasks/08_dict_config.py) → dictionary basics: length, key access, and iteration with items()
- [09_set_operations.py](tasks/09_set_operations.py) → set basics: uniqueness, add() method, length, and iteration
- [10_type_conversions.py](tasks/10_type_conversions.py) → type conversions between int, float, and str; different ways of using print()
- [11_collections_conversion.py](tasks/11_collections_conversion.py) → conversions between list, tuple, set, frozenset, and dict (with name-age pairs)
- [12 mutable vs immutable.py](tasks/12_mutable_vs_immutable.py) → demonstrate id() and difference between immutable (int) vs mutable (list) objects
- [13_investment_with_inflation.py](tasks/13_investment_with_inflation.py) → calculate return on investment after one year considering interest and inflation; display profit, inflation loss, and final capital value
- [14_bank_account_operations.py](tasks/14_bank_account_operations.py) → use augmented assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to simulate and display step-by-step transactions on a bank account balance
- [15_comparison_operators.py](tasks/15_comparison_operators.py) → use comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, <=) and conditional statements to evaluate expressions and display logical results for numbers and strings
- [16_rollercoaster_eligibility.py](tasks/16_rollercoaster_eligibility.py) → use comparison and logical operators (and) with if statements to check if a person meets the age and height requirements for a rollercoaster ride
- [17_logical_operators.py](tasks/17_logical_operators.py) → use logical operators (and, or, not) to evaluate multiple conditions and display context-based messages depending on work, weather, holidays, and code quality
- [18_membership_operators.py](tasks/18_membership_operators.py) → use membership operators (in, not in) with lists, tuples, and dictionaries to check element or key presence and display corresponding messages
- [19_identity_operators.py](tasks/19_identity_operators.py) → use identity operators (is, is not) to compare objects and demonstrate how variable references and assignments affect object identity in memory
- [20_concatenation_operator.py](tasks/20_concatenation_operator.py) → use the concatenation operator (+) to join strings and lists, apply length checks with if statements, and verify substring presence in a greeting message
- [21_conditional_statements.py](tasks/21_conditional_statements.py) → use if, elif, and else statements with independent and nested conditions to analyze numeric values and display messages for multiple logical cases
- [22_blood_donation_qualification.py](tasks/22_blood_donation_qualification.py) → use if, elif, and else statements with logical operators to check age and weight conditions for blood donation eligibility
- [23_candidate_qualification_check.py](tasks/23_candidate_qualification_check.py) → use if, else, and logical operators (and, or, in) to verify a candidate’s experience, programming languages, and contract type for job eligibility
- [24_dog_age_calculator.py](tasks/24_dog_age_calculator.py) → use if, elif, and else statements to convert a dog’s age into human years using conditional formulas and input validation
- [25_temperature_check.py](tasks/25_temperature_check.py) → use if, elif, else, and logical operators to decide whether to go outside or stay home based on rain, umbrella availability, and temperature conditions
