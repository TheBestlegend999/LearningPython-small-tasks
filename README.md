# Python Learning Journey ♻️

This repository documents my journey of learning Python.  
I started from the very basics and will be adding new tasks, exercises, and projects as I progress.  
The goal is to build strong foundations in Python and eventually move into Machine Learning and AI.

## 📂 Tasks & Exercises

Below is a collection of Python tasks I have completed step by step.  
Each file contains a small program or exercise that demonstrates a specific concept in Python.  

- [01_email_variables.py](tasks/01_email_variables.py) → practice with variables (email properties: title, sender, receiver, etc.)
- [02_average_numbers.py](tasks/02_average_numbers.py) → calculate the average of numbers and check its type
- [03_bmi_calculator.py](tasks/03_bmi_calculator.py) → calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) from weight and height
- [04_user_input_summary.py](tasks/04_user_input_summary.py) → collect user input (name, surname, city) and display a summary sentence
- [05_if_statement_number_check.py](tasks/05_if_statement_number_check.py) → check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if statements
- [06_list_operations.py](tasks/06_list_operations.py) → list creation, deletion, membership check, and iteration with arithmetic operations
